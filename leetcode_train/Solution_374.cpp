//We are playing the Guess Game.The game is as follows :
//
//I pick a number from 1 to n.You have to guess which number I picked.
//
//Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number is higher or lower.
//
//You call a pre - defined API guess(int num) which returns 3 possible results(-1, 1, or 0) :
//
//	-1 : My number is lower
//	1 : My number is higher
//	0 : Congrats!You got it!
